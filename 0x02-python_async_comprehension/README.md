Asynchronous Generators and Async Comprehensions in Python
Project Overview
This project focuses on key concepts related to asynchronous programming in Python. The goal is to help you understand and implement asynchronous generators and comprehensions while ensuring proper type annotations. Asynchronous programming allows for more efficient code execution, especially in handling I/O-bound tasks, without blocking the main program flow.

Key Concepts Covered:
Asynchronous Generators:

Learn how to write generators that can yield values asynchronously. These generators allow you to pause and resume the generatorâ€™s execution, which is useful when working with tasks that require waiting (e.g., API calls, file operations).
Async Comprehensions:

Understand how to use comprehensions within asynchronous functions, making your code cleaner and more readable while handling asynchronous iterations.
Type-Annotating Generators:

Proper type annotations ensure clarity and catch potential issues during development. This project will guide you on how to type-annotate both synchronous and asynchronous generators for improved code readability and reliability.
Why is this important?
In modern Python development, especially when dealing with tasks that involve network requests, file I/O, or large data processing, asynchronous code becomes essential for performance optimization. Mastering asynchronous generators and comprehensions can help you write non-blocking, efficient, and scalable Python applications.

This project aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to implement and fully understand asynchronous programming techniques in Python.
